HOW TO RUN 

### Clinical Trials

All codes are under Clinical Trials directory.

### TL;DR

py ClinicalTrialsPolicy.py

### Code Structure

- Model: ClinicalTrialsModel.py
- Policy: ClinicalTrialsPolicy.py
  - model_A_policy
  - model_B_policy
  - model_C_extension_policy
  - model_C_policy
- Driver: ClinicalTrialsDriverScript.py

### Detailed Explanation

1. To run the clinical trials model with a random policy, simply run ClinicalTrialsModel.py as is. 
You will be able to see the output and can experiment with changing the parameters values in the Trials Parameters.xls file.
2. To run the clinical trials model with other available policies (Model A, Model B, Model C, and Model C Extension), open ClinicalTrialsDriverScript.py, 
replace "model_B" in P.run_policy(policy_info, "model_B", t) (line 55) with your desired policy, and run the code. Alternatively, replace "model_C" in
policy = "model_C" (line 66) with the desired policy or add in code for a different policy. Experiment with different policies and parameters.
3. When running the policy for Model C, an OptimizeWarning message may show up. This can be ignored, as it does not affect the output.
4. All codes print out the state variables at each time t which result from the simulation. At the end, the "Stopping state:" corresponds to the final state
of the system, which can be used to compute the policy value. 
5. For testing problem sets: Please ignore the code for model_C_extension_value_fn.
